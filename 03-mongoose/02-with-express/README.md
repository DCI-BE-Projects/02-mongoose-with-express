    - We talked about mongoose, the ODM for mongoDB

**today**
    - we will review all of the above

## MVC

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**:
  - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
  - **View**: Represents the user interface.
  - **Controller**: Handles user input and interacts with the model.
  - **Purpose**: To separate concerns and improve the organization of code.

## ODM and ORM

- **ODM (Object-Document Mapping)**:
  - Maps documents from a document-oriented database to objects in a programming language.
  - Example: Mongoose for MongoDB.
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**:
  - Maps tables from a relational database to objects in a programming language.
  - Example: Sequelize for SQL databases.

## Mongoose for MongoDB

- **Overview**:
  - Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB.
  - Provides a schema-based solution to model your data.
  - Allows for data validation, casting, and business logic hooks.
